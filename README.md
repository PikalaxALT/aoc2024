# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my code solutions for Advent of Code 2024.

## System requirements

cmake 3.30 or later
C++ compilers and standard libraries supporting C++23 features
Boost 1.82.0 or later

## To compile

```
mkdir -p build
cmake . -B build
cmake --build build
```

## Set up data

Save your test cases from [the server](https://adventofcode.com/2024) in `data/testcases`. Identify each file simply by the day number eg. `1.txt`.

## To run

Simply run the executable for the desired day eg. `build/aoc2024_1` for the day 1 executable.
